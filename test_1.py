Reading the Term and Condition in Jobstreet.ph is very not good 



Breaking the TOS 
Breaking a website's Terms of Service (ToS) for web scraping‚Äîeven if the data is public‚Äîcarries legal, ethical, and technical risks. Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown:

1. Legal Risks
Violation of ToS: If a website explicitly forbids scraping in its ToS (e.g., "automated data collection is prohibited"), scraping violates a binding contract. Courts in the US and EU have ruled this can lead to lawsuits (e.g., hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn had mixed outcomes).

Copyright/Database Laws: Public data ‚â† free to scrape. Compilations of data may be protected (e.g., EU‚Äôs Database Directive). Copying entire datasets could infringe copyright.

CFAA (US): Bypassing technical barriers (e.g., login walls) may be deemed "unauthorized access," risking federal charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

2. Ethical Concerns
Server Impact: Scraping can overload servers, harming the site for other users.

Privacy: "Public" data (e.g., social media posts) might still have ethical privacy boundaries.

Fairness: If the site offers a paid API, scraping undermines their business model.

3. When "Public Data" Isn‚Äôt a Free Pass
Robots.txt/ToS: Ignoring these signals is unethical and may escalate to legal action.

Jurisdiction: Laws vary (e.g., GDPR in Europe restricts scraping personal data, even if public).

Precedent: Courts increasingly side with websites (e.g., Facebook v. Power Ventures).

Safer Alternatives ‚úÖ
Respect ToS/robots.txt: Check both before scraping.

Use Official APIs: Always prefer sanctioned methods (e.g., Twitter/X API).

Request Permission: Contact the site for written consent.

Public Datasets: Use government portals (data.gov), academic repositories, or licensed datasets.

Limit Scale/Aggression: Avoid disrupting services; use rate limiting.

Bottom Line
"Public" doesn‚Äôt mean "unregulated." While some cases (e.g., non-commercial research) may have fair-use arguments, violating ToS remains risky. Consult a lawyer for critical projects. When in doubt: prioritize ethics, legality, and transparency.

Note: This is not legal advice. Laws evolve‚Äîalways seek expert counsel.


üü¢ 1. Government-Sanctioned Portal (Recommended)
PhilJobNet (philjobnet.gov.ph)

Status: Official PH government platform under the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Explicitly encourages public access to job data for employment matching 9.

Scraping Permissions:

Free public access to job listings, employer details, and labor market information.

No prohibitions against automated data collection in ToS (unlike commercial sites).

Designed as a national "one-stop shop" for job data 9.

Data Fields: Job titles, companies, locations, posting dates, employment types, application URLs.

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Free Job Boards with Implied Consent
These sites host publicly posted jobs but lack explicit scraping policies. Proceed cautiously:

Jora Philippines (jora.com/ph): Aggregates jobs from multiple sources; lightweight interface 6.

Pinoy Jobs: Local job board emphasizing "safe hiring," likely tolerant of non-invasive scraping 6.

GradPhilippines: Targets students/graduates; job data is publicly listed for applicants 6.

Bossjob: Focuses on job matching; public listings suggest permissive use 6.
Guidelines:

Check robots.txt (e.g., User-agent: * allows scraping).

Avoid high-frequency requests to prevent server strain.
