# 1. What is robots.txt?
r'''
Definition: a Plain Text File in a Root of Website
My Own QUestion: What does it mean by Root of Website? 
'''
# 2. What is Purpose of robot.txt?
r'''
To Communicate guidelines from the website owner to automated agents 
(like Search Engine Crawlers or scrapper) to which part of the site should not be accessed
'''
# 3 What is Structure or Simple Directives?
r'''
User-agent: Specifies which bot(s) the rules apply to (e.g., User-agent: * for all bots).
Disallow: Blocks access to specific paths (e.g., Disallow: /private/).
Allow: Creates exceptions to Disallow rules (less common).
Crawl-delay: Requests a delay between bot requests (in seconds).
Sitemap: Points to the XML sitemap location.

# 4. What is the Relevance for Web Scrapper?
r'''
2. Relevance for Web Scrapers
Ethical/Legal Compliance:
    Ignoring robots.txt may violate a website's terms of service.
    Scraping disallowed areas could lead to legal action (e.g., under the CFAA in the US) or bans.
Avoiding Blocks:
    Websites actively monitor bots. Violating robots.txt increases the risk of IP bans, CAPTCHAs, or rate limiting.

Resource Optimization:
    Avoid wasting time scraping off-limits or irrelevant pages.

Sitemap Discovery:
    The Sitemap directive often lists all publicly accessible URLs, making scraping more efficient.

# 5. Level of Skill for Robot.txt: "Impact on robots.txt Treatment"
'''
Skill Level	
Beginner	
May overlook robots.txt, risking blocks or legal issues. Unable to parse complex rules.

Intermediate	
Checks robots.txt manually but might misinterpret directives (e.g., path patterns, wildcards).

Advanced	
Automates parsing using libraries (e.g., Python's urllib.robotparser). Implements crawl-delay, respects disallows programmatically.

Expert	
Integrates robots.txt compliance into scraping architecture (e.g., proxy rotation, dynamic delay adjustment). Uses sitemaps for efficient crawling.

# Defining my Skills:
r'''
My Question in the Intermediate Part:
What does it mean by:
    1. Directives
    2. Path 
    3. Pattern 
    4. wild Cards

My Question in Advance: 
    1. There are thing called parsing using the libaries of Robotparser 
        * Implementing the Crawl Delay (To not Overload the Server)
        * Respect "Disallow"
Code: 
from urllib.robotparser import RobotFileParser
rp = RobotFileParser()
rp.set_url("https://example.com/robots.txt")
rp.read()
can_scrape = rp.can_fetch("MyScraperBot", "https://example.com/public-page/")

Handle Crawl-delay: Implement delays between requests (e.g., time.sleep() in Python) to avoid overloading servers.

Check Wildcards & Paths: Understand that Disallow: /folder blocks all subpaths (e.g., /folder/file.txt).

Respect User-agent: If your bot has a name, check rules specific to it (e.g., User-agent: MyScraperBot).=

# Advanced scrapers treat it as essential inputâ€”parsing it programmatically, respecting restrictions, and leveraging sitemaps.
# An Excellent Tool for Understanding the Website Structure for Sitemaps (Xml Documetns or Even Hidden Areas of the Website like Directories or search pagse)

I think this is Similar to Jora Which i currently Reading in Reddit 

I am planning on building a website which scrapes data from other websites on the internet and shows it on our website in real-time (while also giving credit to the website that data is scraped from).

However, most of those websites have robots.txt or some kind of crawler blockers and I would like to understand what is the best way to get through this issue.
'''

From Reddit
robots.txt is just a request by the owner in a technical spec that says what he wishes bots would do. It is not a technical blocker.

There are other technical blockers like rate limiting and identifying you as a bot due to your activity patterns, that changes between sites, somewhat correlated to what they offer as they would perceive the value to protect against unwanted bots
