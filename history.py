July 28 2025:
    1. Starting to Create "history.py" to document what i'm going to do in Project_Job_PH
    2. Why i created this project? 
        * To Showcase my Skill in Playwright and overall Web Scrapping Skills 
        * For Personal use to Determine what is the current Demand on Job in the Philippines targeting the specific Career Path and their Hard Skills, Location, and information 
            - for Example "Mechatronics Engineer or Mechatronics Technician" The Average Salary, What hard Skills are Needed, What Location are Currently finding it? 
    3. My Implementation or my "Meta Proccess"
        * Jumping with an Uncofident in my Skills in terms of the Foundation or Core in "Playwright"
        * Implementing the Project Learning Approach in this Case
